# GloboFly ‚úàÔ∏è

**GloboFly** is a modern Android app built with Kotlin that lets you explore, add, update, and delete global travel destinations. The app uses Retrofit to interact with a live REST API (Node.js, hosted on Railway). Its clean interface and modular structure make it a great example for Android networking and CRUD operations.

## Features

üåç **Browse Destinations**
- View a list of all travel spots from the cloud API.

‚ûï **Add Destinations**
- Fill in city, country, and description to add a new destination.

‚úèÔ∏è **Edit & Delete**
- Update or remove destinations with simple forms.

üîó **Live API Integration**
- All data synced in real-time with a Node.js backend via Retrofit.

üöÄ **Modern Android UI**
- Material look, navigation, and responsive layouts.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MohsinMuzamil/GloboFly-.git
    ```
2. **Open in Android Studio**

3. **Run the app**
    - Connect your device or start an emulator.
    - Click ‚ÄúRun‚Äù.

**No backend setup required:** uses the live API at

- **DestinationListActivity** ‚Äì Lists all destinations
- **DestinationDetailActivity** ‚Äì View, edit, or delete a destination
- **DestinationCreateActivity** ‚Äì Add a new destination
- **DestinationAdapter** ‚Äì Powers destination RecyclerView
- **DestinationService** ‚Äì Retrofit interface for API endpoints
- **ServiceBuilder** ‚Äì Configures Retrofit with live API base URL

## API & Networking

- **Powered by [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)** for all HTTP requests
- **Live backend**: Node.js API, always online via [Railway](https://railway.app/)
- **Endpoints:**
    - `GET /destination` ‚Äì List all destinations
    - `POST /destination` ‚Äì Add new destination
    - `PUT /destination/{id}` ‚Äì Update destination
    - `DELETE /destination/{id}` ‚Äì Remove destination

---

## Requirements

- Android Studio (latest)
- Kotlin
- Min SDK: as defined in `build.gradle`
- Retrofit & Gson
- Material Components

---

## How It Works

1. **Welcome Screen:** Tap to start.
2. **Destination List:** See all places from the live API.
3. **Add/Edit/Delete:** Use forms to manage destinations. Actions sync instantly with the backend.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note for Android 5.1.1 (Lollipop) and Older Devices

If you run GloboFly on Android 5.1.1 or similar older versions, you may encounter the following error when the app tries to connect to the API over HTTPS:

```
java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Trust anchor for certification path not found.
```

**Reason:**  
Older Android versions do not trust many modern SSL certificates by default, causing HTTPS connection failures.

**Workaround Implemented:**  
To allow development and testing on these devices, we've used a custom `UnsafeOkHttpClient` that disables SSL certificate validation in development builds. This is integrated in `ServiceBuilder.kt`:

```kotlin
private val okHttp = UnsafeOkHttpClient.getUnsafeOkHttpClient()
```

**Warning:**  
> This disables all SSL checks and should only be used for development or testing on old Android devices.  
> **Never use this approach in production apps** as it makes your connection insecure and vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**For production or newer devices:**  
- This workaround is not used; secure SSL connections will operate as normal.
- For best security, run the app on Android 7.0+ or ensure your backend uses certificates compatible with old devices.

## üïπÔ∏è Legacy Android Support Branch

If you are using Android 5.1.1 or any device that requires the SSL workaround, please switch to the dedicated branch for legacy support:

- **Branch name:** `legacy-android-support`

You can check out this branch with:

```bash
git checkout legacy-android-support
```

This branch includes the `UnsafeOkHttpClient` workaround described above. For all other users, the main branch is recommended.
